# Landing-page-Udacity-Graduation-Project

## I made this project as a submission to Udacity, the project requires using vanilla Js to turn the page from static to dynamic state

### I used starter files (HTML and CSS) from udacity and edited them a bit
### I wrote all the javascript code using only vanilla javascript

#### overview of the changes made:
1- added the nav bar dynamically to create nav items for each new section (when adding a new section in the HTML file, you get a tab related to that section on the Navbar)
2-prevented the default scroll action when clicking on the links and converted it into smooth scrolling to the related section (made the scroll effect smooth)
3-highlighted the active section and its link in the nav bar
4-added the scroll to top Arrow button to appear at the bottom of the window where the user can click to scroll to the top of the page
5-hid the nav bar and the scroll to top button when the user isn't scrolling
6-made the page responsive to appear properly on different screens
